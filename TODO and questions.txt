TODO:
================================================================================================
- make write_data2 to write data in the format for order_parameter

- make output file name(s) readable from command line

- understand crystal.c?



------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
= make read_data2 to read from .poly files (i.e. to make it able to read the files it makes)
	= make the initial configuration file something to be entered on the command line
= check read_data2, is probably still bugged.
	= nope, i set packing fraction when reading but that should only happen when creating
= check if cell lists are fixed
	= YES
= read_data2 can be found in tests/test.c!
= generate initial configuration





Notes:

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Last runs:
- _6fix: apply per bd cond upon find
- _6test: exit upon find
	- no exits
- newcl: new (conventional) method of doing celllists + prints & apply per. bd. cnd.
	- no prints
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Last meeting:
= Instead of celllength >= diam + max_step_size, and update celllist after completed step,
	do celllength >= diam and update celllist after move, and again if move back.
= Pipe stdout to a log file rather than /dev/null

Since overlap seems to occur right at the boundary of the box, maybe something funny is
	going on when saying x_new = (int) r_new.x / CellLength;. HOWEVER, sometimes, e.g. at
	pressure 1 for one particular simulation (TODO: which one), it happens everywhere.
	Nevertheless, the following tests will run for the weekend:

- sl10v2: increased MAXPC, probably not gonna do anything (PNGDA)
	- indeed, overlap still happens.

- sl10v3: increased MAXPC, pos_mod_f in update_cell_list(), PNGDA
	- exit status (5), Too many particles in one cell???

- dbg: increased MAXPC, pos_mod_f in update_cell_list(), exit(6) upon overshooting, PNGDA
	- exit status (5), Too many particles in one cell???

- dbg2: increased MAXPC, exit(6) upon overshooting, PNGDA
	- exit status (6), overshoot indeed happens!

- sl10d: increased MAXPC, increased precision of math4d.h (math5d.h, where float --> double)
	- (seemingly) no overlaps!





Questions:
================================================================================================
- Ask Frank:
	- What is typedef struct {double nz; double si; double co ;int n;}bndT;
		-
	- What is typedef struct {int n; bndT * bnd;}blistT;
		-
	- Is particlestocount == n_part always true?
		-

= Randomly orienting, is 12 rotations of \pm pi/2 around random axes aligned with box enough?
	= yes
