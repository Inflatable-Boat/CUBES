% Note that we have done our best to make a file that can be used for a thesis and we can help you if you have any problems, but we are not responsible for any issues that may occur.

% First we have to declare what kind of document this is. For a thesis, the usual options are article (for normal theses), report (for slightly larger theses) or book (for 100 or more pages of thesis). Report is rarely used and not supported as well as the article class:
\documentclass{article}

\input{preamble}

%\linespread{1.1}

\begin{document}

\subfile{titlepage}

\frontmatter

\subfile{abstract}
\clearpage
\tableofcontents


\mainmatter % We want normal pagenumbers here.
\subfile{introduction}
% Introduction

\subfile{nucleation_theory}
% What is nucleation?, What are the standard theories?  
% standard MC, umbrella sampling
\subfile{nucleation_results}
